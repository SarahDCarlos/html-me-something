            <h3> A Brief History of Matcha </h3>
            <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0582/9581/2256/files/Untitled_design_-_2023-04-07T185125.635_480x480.png?v=1680861116" />
            <p>The tale of matcha dates back to the Tang Dynasty in China, around the 7th to 10th centuries. the method of making powdered tea from steam-prepared dried tea leaves, became popular in 12th century. That is when matcha was discovered by a Buddhist monk, Myoan Eisai, and brought to Japan. Drinking matcha not only aided the meditation efforts of Zen monks but also became a means in attaining enlightenment itself. </p>
            <p>Sacrificing a bowl of the drink to Buddha was part of everyday temple practices. the ensuing Song Dynasty, which reigned from the 10th â€“ 13th, is largely credited with making this form of tea preparation popular. Eisai, a Japanese Buddhist Monk, spent the better part of his life studying Buddhism in China. In 1191, Eisai returned permanently to Japan, bringing with him tea seeds along with the Zen Buddhist methods of preparing powdered green tea.</p>
